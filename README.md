# Teeth Segmentation using Active Shape Models

In forensic investigations, dental records are often relied upon to accurately
identify deceased persons. Manual comparison of ante-mortem and post-mortem
records, however, is a tedious and time-consuming job. Automating this process 
would save the investigators a lot of time. The first step towards a comparison is 
segmentation of the teeth. The!goal of this project is to develop a model-based
segmentation approach, capable of segmenting the upper and lower incisors in
panoramic radiographs.
